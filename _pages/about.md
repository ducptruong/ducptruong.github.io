I am a post-doc at [Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://lanl.gov) in the Information Sciences group (CCS-3). 

I obtained a Ph.D. in Computational and Applied Mathematics in 2020 from the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.smu.edu/Dedman/academics/departments/math) at [Southern Methodist University](https://www.smu.edu), under the supervision of [Dr. Andrea Barreiro](https://s2.smu.edu/abarreiro/).

My current work focuses on developing matrix/tensor factorization algorithms and engineering machine learning techniques with applications in economics, biology, and high dimensional scientific simulations.

Research Interest
====================
- Develop matrix/tensor factorization models with applications in machine learning, deep learning acceleration, PDE solvers, etc.
- Design a data analysis pipeline for specific data analysis tasks.
- Incorporate neuroscience understandings into machine learning models.
